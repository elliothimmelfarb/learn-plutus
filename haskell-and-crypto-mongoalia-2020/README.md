# Notes

## Data Types

### `data`, `type`, and `newtype`

- `data` creates a new data type which can have one or more constructors.
- `type` gives a new name to an existing data type.
- `newtype` is similar to `data` but it only works for data types that have exactly 1 constructor with exactly 1 argument.
- [`newtype` on Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Newtype)
